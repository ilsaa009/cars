Finished in GT Silver Metallic (protected by full body 3M paint protection film) over a Black leather and Guards Red-accented cabin, this ultimate 991-generation 911 is the definition of Stuttgart exotica.\n\nGT3-derived bodywork and a screaming flat-6 engine. That clipped and raked windshield. A convertible soft top extending into gloriously contoured rear streamliners. And a 6-speed manual. This 2019 Porsche 911 Speedster was the first convertible the automaker’s famed GT division ever built and - unsurprisingly - it’s incredible.\n\nReleased as a 70th-anniversary celebration of Porsche and as an unofficial send-off to the 991 911 series, only 1,948 of these Speedsters were produced. Blending the unadulterated sound of the period GT3’s thoroughbred flat-6 with a host of 911 R components, the Speedster was developed as a GT model with breathtaking design.\n\nOnly offered with three pedals, these Speedsters are further distinguished with a single-piece carbon fiber rear lid and streamliners, individual throttle bodies and high-pressure fuel injectors, a cross-car brace behind the seats, unique springs, and inverted motorsport-spec adjustable Bilstein dampers.\n\nAs its enthusiast owner notes, this GT Silver stunner “...delivers a masterclass of all-around 911 performance…” and is “...just as engaging and visceral as the cars it’s based on…",

Finished in GT Silver Metallic (protected by full body 3M paint protection film) over a Black leather and Guards Red-accented cabin, this ultimate 991-generation 911 is the definition of Stuttgart exotica.\n\nGT3-derived bodywork and a screaming flat-6 engine. That clipped and raked windshield. A convertible soft top extending into gloriously contoured rear streamliners. And a 6-speed manual. This 2019 Porsche 911 Speedster was the first convertible the automaker’s famed GT division ever built and - unsurprisingly - it’s incredible.\n\nReleased as a 70th-anniversary celebration of Porsche and as an unofficial send-off to the 991 911 series, only 1,948 of these Speedsters were produced. Blending the unadulterated sound of the period GT3’s thoroughbred flat-6 with a host of 911 R components, the Speedster was developed as a GT model with breathtaking design.\n\nOnly offered with three pedals, these Speedsters are further distinguished with a single-piece carbon fiber rear lid and streamliners, individual throttle bodies and high-pressure fuel injectors, a cross-car brace behind the seats, unique springs, and inverted motorsport-spec adjustable Bilstein dampers.\n\nAs its enthusiast owner notes, this GT Silver stunner “...delivers a masterclass of all-around 911 performance…” and is “...just as engaging and visceral as the cars it’s based on…",

Blending the unadulterated sound of the period GT3’s thoroughbred flat-6 with a host of 911 R components, the Speedster was developed as a GT model with breathtaking design.\n\nOnly offered with three pedals, these Speedsters are further distinguished with a single-piece carbon fiber rear lid and streamliners, individual throttle bodies and high-pressure fuel injectors, a cross-car brace behind the seats, unique springs, and inverted motorsport-spec adjustable Bilstein dampers.\n\nAs its enthusiast owner notes, this GT Silver stunner “...delivers a masterclass of all-around 911 performance…” and is “...just as engaging and visceral as the cars it’s based on…",

      "overview": "SBX Cars is proud to offer for sale this 2019 Porsche 911 Speedster showing just 7,777 miles on the odometer at the time of cataloging. Finished in GT Silver Metallic (protected by full body 3M paint protection film) over a Black leather and Guards Red-accented cabin, this ultimate 991-generation 911 is the definition of Stuttgart exotica.\n\nGT3-derived bodywork and a screaming flat-6 engine. That clipped and raked windshield. A convertible soft top extending into gloriously contoured rear streamliners. And a 6-speed manual. This 2019 Porsche 911 Speedster was the first convertible the automaker’s famed GT division ever built and - unsurprisingly - it’s incredible.\n\nReleased as a 70th-anniversary celebration of Porsche and as an unofficial send-off to the 991 911 series, only 1,948 of these Speedsters were produced. Blending the unadulterated sound of the period GT3’s thoroughbred flat-6 with a host of 911 R components, the Speedster was developed as a GT model with breathtaking design.\n\nOnly offered with three pedals, these Speedsters are further distinguished with a single-piece carbon fiber rear lid and streamliners, individual throttle bodies and high-pressure fuel injectors, a cross-car brace behind the seats, unique springs, and inverted motorsport-spec adjustable Bilstein dampers.\n\nAs its enthusiast owner notes, this GT Silver stunner “...delivers a masterclass of all-around 911 performance…” and is “...just as engaging and visceral as the cars it’s based on…",
